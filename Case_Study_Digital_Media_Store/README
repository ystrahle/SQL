# 🎵 Digital Media Store Sales & Customer Analytics (Chinook SQL Case Study)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchases, sales performance, and product trends for a **global digital media store**. Using SQL, I explored customer demographics, sales agents’ performance, and product sales patterns to uncover key insights into **revenue drivers** and **market opportunities**.

The goal was to approach the dataset as if I were supporting a real business, focusing on questions that stakeholders care about:
- Which customers and regions contribute the most revenue?
- How do sales agents compare in driving results year over year?
- What product categories (tracks, genres, media types) are the strongest performers?

## ❓ Business Objectives
- Identify **customers outside the US** and highlight opportunities for regional growth.
- Track **customer segments in Brazil** and analyze their purchasing behavior.
- Evaluate **sales agents’ contribution** to revenue, including top performers by year.
- Measure **total sales by year** and compare growth trends across the business.
- Analyze **product performance** by track, album, genre, and media type.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **International customers** drive significant sales volume outside the US, with Brazil emerging as a notable market.
- **Sales agents** play a critical role in revenue: performance rotates by year, but in 2009, **Steve Johnson** led with the highest total sales.
- **Rock and Latin genres** appear frequently in high-volume sales, highlighting strong customer demand.
- **Track-level analysis** reveals revenue concentration in specific albums and artists, which can inform licensing and marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **SQL (SQLite)**: Joins, aggregations, CTEs, date filtering, window functions
- **Schema design thinking**: mapping join paths across 11 related tables
- **Business analysis**: translating raw queries into stakeholder insights
