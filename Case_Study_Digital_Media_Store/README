# Chinook SQL Final Project — Digital Media Store Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project translates real business questions into SQL using the public **Chinook** database (a digital media store with customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, genres, and employees). The goal is to show how an analyst navigates a multi-table schema, chooses the right join paths, and turns queries into business-facing answers (totals, rankings, and lookups).

**What’s covered**
- Queries that answer 14 core prompts (customers, invoices, sales agents, tracks, artists, genres).
- Safe date filtering with inclusive/exclusive ranges (e.g., all of 2009).
- Clean join paths such as **Invoice → Invoice_Items → Tracks → Albums → Artists**.
- A small “extra” analysis to demonstrate curiosity beyond the prompts.

**Why this matters**
Rather than focusing on syntax alone, this project emphasizes:
- **Schema thinking** (where the data lives and how to get to it),
- **Business context** (what the numbers mean),
- **Reusability** (readable SQL that another analyst can run and audit).

**Tools**
- SQLite (Chinook sample database)
- SQL (ANSI-style queries; minor naming differences may exist across Chinook variants)

> Note: If your Chinook uses different table/column casing (e.g., `InvoiceLine` vs `invoice_items`), adjust identifiers accordingly. The logic and join paths remain the same.
