# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My SQL Portfolio  

Thanks for stopping by! This repository is a collection of SQL projects and practice work that Iâ€™ve completed while learning and applying data skills. My goal is to showcase not only technical queries, but also how SQL can be used to solve real-world problems and answer meaningful business questions.
